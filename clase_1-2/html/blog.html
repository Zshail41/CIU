        <h2>Short biography</h2>

        <p>
            John Clayton Mayer (/ˈmeɪ.ər/; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and record producer. Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, 
            but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his 
            skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, Inside Wants Out. 
            His following two full-length albums—Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal 
            Performance for the single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
